A 2D brawler/platformer that I am using to improve my game development skills

I am using this project to learn C++ and improve game dev skills, particularly around learning Entity Component Systems.
I know that I am not currently using the most performant of an ECS implementation because it uses maps to index components
but I wanted to get <i>something</i> out there before I start iterating on the design (using inner/outer arrays to index
and pack similar components tightly).

If you have any suggestions feel free to message me here, or at kwanzek (a) gmail dot com!
